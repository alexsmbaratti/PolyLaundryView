# PolyLaundryView (Deprecated)
A simple program that parses LaundryView for ASU Century Hall Residents on the third floor. Uses LaundryView's HTML to manually parse and log statuses for washers and dryers. (Trust me, if they had an API, I would use it.) Also, considering that the LaundryView site uses flash and looks very old, this can be the framework for making the interface look better.

Note: The site used retrieve data from changed format, rendering this program useless. 

## Planned Ideas
* Alexa Integration through AWS Lambda
* Pick any floor or room
